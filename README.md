<h1>Azure SIEM Integration for Honeypot-based Threat Analysis </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a creating a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure. The whole idea for this VM was to make it so enticing for outside threats to attack the machine. Then, the logs for the virtual machine is inputted into Log analytics workspace. Azure sentinel is then set up so I was able to map the location of where the attacks were coming from. Powershell scripts were used to extract ip addresses from the attackers and an outside API was used to find the longitude and longitude locations of the attacks.

<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Sentinel</b>
- <b>Azure Log Analytics Workspace </b> 
- <b>Azure VM</b>

<h2>What I learned </h2>
Make sure all your devices and anything that you will connect to the internet with is properly secured. As soon as I made the VM live, attacks were coming in from all across the world. Aside from that, this project allowed me to get more comfortable navigating the Azure portal and incorparating the different services it provides together.
